New York (CNN) Elon Musk says he wants a significantly larger stake in Tesla than
the one that already made him the richest person on the planet.

In a series of posts on X Monday night, Musk said that he would not want to grow
Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics without a compensation
plan that would give him ownership of around 25% of the company’s stock. That
would be about double the roughly 13% stake he currently owns.

“I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having
~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be
overturned,” Musk wrote in a post on X. “Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build
products outside of Tesla.”

Notably, Musk held a stake of more than 20% in Tesla before he sold a large number of
shares to buy X, the social media company he purchased over a year ago for $44
billion.

Tesla remains the leader in electric vehicles, but the competition is gaining ground.
Musk has said the company’s future lies in AI and robotics. In January 2022, he said
on a call with Wall Street analysts that he believes the company’s goal of building a
humanoid robot is the most important technology it’s developing. Musk said of its
planned robot, “This I think has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle
business over time.”
