Over a year ago, Putin launched the largest European land war since World War Two.
0:35
Despite his inability to secure a quick victory and despite Russia being slapped with the the most comprehensive sanctions imposed on a major power in nearly a century, the Russian
0:45
economy has defied all odds and exceeded even the most optimistic predictions.
0:50
While the rest of the world expected Russia to be crippled, the economy only shrunk by a measly 2.1%.
0:57
Even more shockingly, it is expected to return to growth this year and could even outpace the United Kingdom and Germany.
1:05
Inflation did increase, but it wasn't as dramatic compared to the European Union when taking into account historic trends, meanwhile unemployment is at an all-time low.
1:15
The Russian currency, the Rouble, took a huge hit initially but quickly bounced back to
1:20
eight-year highs just months after the invasion began. To top it all off, in 2022, Russia has experienced its largest inflow of revenue and its largest
1:30
trade surplus since its formation from the ashes of the Communist Soviet Union.
1:35
This financial support has given Putin all the resources he needs to continue fueling his bloody military conquest, despite the Western world conducting what amounts to a
1:45
full scale economic war in response. It's hard to fathom how Russia's economy has not only survived but seemling thrived amidst
1:52
the turmoil. Some wonder if Putin has crafted a blueprint for other nations with territorial aspirations
1:58
to follow, or if this is all just an economic mirage that will soon fade away.
2:04
Yet the roots of this issue dates back well before conflict in Ukraine, Well before Putin came to power and well before the Russian state we know today even existed.
2:14
Russia's ability to stave off collapse and continue fighting today and in the future, lay not in the current state of affairs but embedded within the fundamental traits it
2:23
inherited from the Soviet Union, the precarious path of reform in which it developed, and
2:29
the delicate political economy Putin has carefully crafted over the last 22 years.
2:34
Afterall, armed conflicts are frequently determined by economic power, while the intricate interplay
2:40
between history and politics plays a crucial role in shaping a nation's economy and how
2:45
it responds in times of crisis. So what is exactly going on, why has Russia’s Economy not collapsed?
2:58
Despite Russia having not collapsed - the U.S economy - has been building towards implosion. Look no further than SVB, one of the largest banks in the US,
3:07
which made global headlines when it collapsed literally overnight just days ago. The disaster didn’t just affect banks, but the entire stock market,
3:16
which saw its worst losses of the year as a result. It shows why, especially in 2022, you can’t have all your eggs in one basket.
3:25
So when considering your choices – let’s take a cue from the world’s best investors. According to a recent groundbreaking study from Ernst & Young,
3:33
8 in 10 ultra-high-net-worth individuals invest in alternatives outside of stocks.
3:38
Things like real estate, gold, and private equity. But Bank of America’s investment head recommends one specific high-performing alternative to
3:47
rescue your cash: Fine art. Don’t believe me? Last year, art prices rose an average of 29%, And Masterworks, the sponsor of this video,
3:57
delivered an unbelievable 10%, 35%, and 14% to its investors with its last 3 art sales.
4:04
See, with Masterworks, diversifying your portfolio with paintings from legends like Banksy and
4:09
Picasso only takes a few clicks. Now, with 650,000-plus members, Masterworks’ offerings can sell out in hours, not days.

The Soviet Union’s Masterplan
4:29
By the late 1960s, the Soviet Union found itself in a precarious situation… By the late 1960s, the Soviet Union found itself in a precarious situation. Despite decades of impressive economic growth, which in just 40 years had transformed the
4:38
country from a backwards agricultural society into an industrial behemoth, capable of defeating
4:44
Germany in World War II and launching the first man and satellite into space, the economy
4:50
was beginning to stagnate. The government, led by a totalitarian communist regime, in which all industry, every price
4:57
for every good, every salary, and the exact input and outputs of materials and goods was
5:02
set by the state, proved wildly successful in growing the economy by simply shifting
5:08
millions of peasants from inefficient farming communities to highly productive heavy industries.
5:13
However, once the citizens were already working in factories, the system proved incapable
5:18
of squeezing out extra productivity from them. This stemmed from an underlying lack of incentives for citizens to work harder, more efficiently,
5:27
or to innovate. Afterall, why do more than is needed if you wouldn't be paid more and it was nearly impossible
5:33
to be fired. While later reforms tried to implement wage scales to improve incentives, when workers
5:38
went to buy goods they often could not do so as shortages came to define the Soviet
5:44
system, while variety and quality of goods remained subpar. The fundamental reforms that would have improved the productivity of the economy never came
5:52
to fruition as it would have necessitated a diminishment of government power and thus
5:57
would have risked toppling the entire regime. Instead, the government embarked on a gargantuan plan to develop the Soviet Union's vast and
6:05
inhospitable Siberian and arctic regions. Tens of millions of people would be forced to build new infrastructure, erect new towns
6:13
and cities from nothing, and eventually to man the many new mines and most critically,
6:18
the sprawling new gas and oil fields. Despite the heavy cost of doing so, this proved to be highly profitable and it could not have
6:25
come at a more opportune time. As war broke out in the Middle East, leading the major oil producing nations to embargo
6:33
the western world, the first oil crisis saw the global price of energy skyrocket by 6
6:39
fold over just 7 years. The Soviet Union, now selling its vast supply of oil to its capitalist rivals quickly became
6:46
flooded in money, and spurred on further expansion of its oil production capabilities.
6:51
By the 1980s it was now the largest producer of oil in the world and every year, hundreds
6:57
of billions of dollars started pouring in. This revenue enabled the Soviet Union to do four very important things.
7:04
The first was it allowed for large imports of food and consumer goods to satisfy a population
7:10
becoming evermore envious of their Western European counterparts. The second was that it was able to continue financing its enormous military.
7:19
Thirdly it used its own oil production to massively subsidize its inefficient industries,
7:24
by artificially dropping the cost of energy at 95% less than the global average.
7:30
Yet most importantly, the Soviet leaders used its oil revenues to import advanced western
7:35
machinery and equipment, in the hopes that this would boost the productivity base of its factories, which in turn would revive economic growth.
7:43
In essence, the Soviet Union was using oil exports to patch up the fundamental flaws
7:48
with its economy, but in the process it became overly reliant upon a single resource.
7:54
Yet even as this proved successful for a period of time, underlying productivity continued
7:59
to erode, while its military burden grew larger as it struggled to keep up with the West and
8:04
embarked on a costly invasion of Afghanistan. Meanwhile its import bill continued to climb as the economy grew more complex and its citizens
8:13
demanded better consumer goods. As a result the economy entered a prolonged period that was referred to by its citizens
8:20
as “the great stagnation”. All of these mounting pressures came to the forefront in 1986 when oil prices plummeted
8:27
by nearly 70%, due to Saudi Arabia dramatically increasing its own oil production.
8:34
Soviet oil revenues, which it had been using to prop up the rest of its economy, plummeted by almost 75%.
8:40
This all but forced new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to implement major new reforms.
8:45
Yet these reforms proved too much for the system as they led to a dramatic unraveling of the highly centralized state apparatus and the planned economy, eventually culminating
8:55
in the collapse of the Soviet Union. Along with 14 other states, The Russian Federation was born from its ashes on Christmas Day 1991
9:05
with Boris Yeltisn as its leader. In the aftermath, Reformers aspired to transform Russia into a typical western nation, characterized
9:13
by democratic values, a capitalist economy and eventually elevated standards of living.
9:18
However, achieving this feat was akin to mending a ship while it was already sailing in the
9:23
middle of the ocean. Despite the horrific atrocities that occurred under the Soviet Union, the magnitude of suffering
Rebuilding From The Ashes
9:33
Russians would endure from its collapse, cannot be overstated. Nevermind it being the largest geopolitical and economic shift in Human history, but all
9:42
of a sudden, the highly controlled and intricate system that governed nearly every aspect of
9:48
its citizens' lives disintegrated almost overnight. The people of Russia were left in a state of uncertainty about what would come next,
9:56
if they still had jobs and if they would be able to buy food tomorrow. At the same time, its new leaders had to contend with building new institutions from scratch
10:05
while grappling with impossible debt obligations, a catastrophic recession, hyperinflation and
10:11
a near total collapse of tax revenue. Not only did the state have almost no financial resources to work with but It also had to
10:19
contend with a huge number of separate political factions fighting for control over economic
10:24
assets and political power. Many former soviet insiders started spontaneously and illegally seizing factories for themselves,
10:32
while other industries which employed millions fell idle due to the soviets complex supply chains and management structure, simply ceasing to function.
10:41
Against this backdrop, the reformers had three key goals, to institute a democratic political
10:47
system that would replace the authoritarian one party rule, build a new state identity
10:52
from the ashes of the Soviet Union, and establish a capitalist economic system to replace the
10:58
planned economy. In an effort to achieve all of this in a sort of shock therapy, they implemented savage
11:05
cuts to government spending, from reducing the size and wages of the military and police,
11:10
to cutting almost all subsidies to industry. This was hoped to not only balance the government's spending bill, but to also force the hugely
11:18
inefficient soviet industries to reorganize and reform to be profitable and more productive.
11:24
To liberalize the economy, the government tore down barriers to international trade, legalized private businesses to be set up and trade feely, and dismantled price controls
11:34
on some 90% of consumer goods. In theory, all of these rapid reforms would inflict necessary but temporary pain, ultimately
11:43
leading to a better functioning economy. At the same time, the rapid decentralization of economic activity would reduce former soviet
11:51
elites' power as they wanted nothing more than to retain the privileges they once enjoyed.
“The People’s Capitalism”
11:57
In practice, the burden on the citizens was catastrophic. In the first month of price controls being lifted inflation rose 225% and ultimately
12:07
2000% from 1991 to 1995. Market stalls sprang up everywhere stocked with never before seen western goods yet most
12:17
couldn't afford them as decades of savings were whipped out instantly by inflation.
12:22
The significant defunding of the police and military security apparatus gave rise to a
12:27
giant wave of crime and violence, In which Russia would go on to have a similar homicide
12:32
rate to cartel-ridden Mexico and Colombia. Giant industries, no longer receiving subsidies, started mass layoffs and or failed to pay
12:41
workers. Unemployment, once nearly zero percent, albeit because of inefficient government mandates,
12:47
rose to over 15%, which does not even capture those not being paid or forced to work part
12:54
time. In sum total, the entire economy contracted by 50%, which is double the decline experienced
13:01
by the United States during the great depression. Millions of Russians fled the nation, while those that stayed stopped having as many children.
13:09
Alcoholism rates, already high to begin with, became epidemic as Life expectancy for men
13:15
dropped to just 57 years, lower than it was in the 1950s Under Joseph Stalin.
13:21
But what truly scared Russia's long term economic outlook, was the complete botched privatization
13:27
of state owned assets as the problem of who should get what, coupled with a weak government
13:32
proved to just be too big of a problem to solve. After 74 Years in which the state largely owned every single factory, every single business,
13:42
and every single store, who exactly do you give ownership to? Initially reformers came up with a plan to allow management and workers to buy shares
13:51
in their place of work. At the same time privatization vouchers were given to all citizens that could be used to
13:57
get partial ownership in companies and or be freely traded. Reformers branded this as the people's capitalism.
14:05
Unfortunately, what really happened was far from it. Amid the economic and political chaos and a now weak government, enterprise managers
14:13
either just took the factories for themselves or forced their employees to give up their shares, while other large industries were given to powerful elites in return for political
14:23
support or bribes. In the most high profile case, amid Yeltsin being convinced that he would lose the upcoming
14:30
election to the still influential communist party, he allowed the most powerful businessmen
14:35
in the country to stake claim to Russia's largest and most profitable industries, in return for support against the communists.
14:43
Instantly these businessmen became the richest and most influential people in all of Russia
14:48
if not the world, and with electoral fraud, Yeltsin barely retained the presidency in
14:53
1996. For the Russian people, this was hard to stomach. After decades of supposedly working for the common good in the most resource rich nation
15:02
on Earth, the vast majority of citizens had nothing to show for it, while a handful of men now controlled a vast portion of the riches.
15:11
However, underlying reforms did start to show improvements to the system. A new flourishing class of entrepreneurs emerged, inflation started to recede as production
15:21
of pricey goods rose, chronic shortages came to an end, and many inefficient industries
15:26
reorganized to become more efficient. However this process was severely curtailed as the government started to roll back certain
15:34
reforms under mounting political and social pressure. In an effort to keep unemployment from rising any higher, credit and subsidies were rolled
15:42
out to struggling industries. Not only did this embolden many industries to continue operating inefficiently as they
15:49
did under the Soviet Union, but when combined with many enterprises proving adept at evading
15:55
taxes, the government found itself unable to balance revenues and expenditures. To make up for the growing deficit, the government started issuing huge amounts of high interest
16:05
short term bonds. Along with a costly and unpopular war to put down Chechen independence fighters, the government
16:12
debts started to grow rapidly. Then in 1997 the Asian financial crisis quickly spread to developing countries and in the
16:20
process plummeted oil prices. As a result, the government defaulted on its domestic debts and private industries defaulted
16:27
on their foreign debts. GDP and the Rouble collapsed, and as confidence was lost in Russia's banking system, huge
16:34
amounts of cash fled the country. By the end of the decade, Despite Russians having lived through the atrocities of the
16:41
Soviet Union, The 1990s proved for many to be the bleakest period of their lives.
16:47
Russia was now dominated by Big business that didn't pay taxes and abused legal and illegal
16:53
methods to stomp down on small and emerging new companies. Corruption ran rampant among the now weakened government, while organized crime terrorized
17:02
the Russian people. This along with weak property rights and a poor business environment, kept investment
17:08
at critically low levels as profits from businesses fled the country to buy luxury yachts and
17:13
property in Europe or were hidden away in offshore bank accounts. As the new millennium and elections approached, the possibility of the Communists returning
17:22
to power loomed large, dimming hopes of reforms that could fix the country's economic woes.
17:29
That quickly changed when a little known ex KGB agent, named Vladimir Putin came along.
Putin’s Russia
17:38
Putin was appointed prime minister on the same day the second Chechen war broke out.
17:44
Amid a more successful military campaign against them and a surprising return to economic growth,
17:49
Putin quickly became the most popular politician in Russia. As such, In a dramatic scene, Yeltsin resigned from the presidency on December 31st 1999,
18:00
placing Putin as acting president and paving the way for a landslide victory in the election just three months later.
18:07
Documented in his “millennium manifesto”, Putin decried the fact that Russia had become the poorest nation in Europe, in which a decade of strong growth would be needed to place
18:17
it on par with Portugal and Spain, hardly rich nations among Europe as is.
18:22
He proposed a comprehensive agenda that included an aggressive campaign against crime, a more
18:28
assertive central government to tackle Russia's disorderly regions and big businesses, and
18:33
a drive for more investment and international integration. He, like many Russia leaders before him, also pointed to the states still over-reliant on
18:42
energy exports as a call to diversify the economy. Indeed, the sudden growth that coincided with Putin taking office, was the result of a massive
18:52
spike in oil prices caused by China's monstrous economic growth and insatiable demand for
18:58
commodities. With political popularity, big business having been crippled from the Asian financial crisis,
19:04
and a significant rise in oil revenues, Putin utilized his window of opportunity to unleashed
19:09
his plans to rebuild a strong central government, provoking fear among reformist that he would
19:15
roll back many of the economic freedoms obtained in the previous decade. He started by re-establishing central control by redrawing Russia's regions and placing
19:24
loyalists in charge. While at the same time, a new bankruptcy law was used to take on Russia's two most powerful
19:31
businessmen, ultimately stripping them of their assets including the two most important independent media groups.
19:38
Putin then held a lavish barbeque outside Moscow with the rest of the powerful business
19:43
owners, implicitly threatening them that if they stayed out of politics and paid their taxes, they would be allowed to keep ownership of their companies.
19:51
At the same time, the government reasserted ownership of Gazprom, the gas industry behemoth
19:57
that descended directly from the Soviet ministry of gas. All together, Putin sent a powerful message about the rebalancing of power between the
20:05
state and private business. Along with this, a new 13% flat tax was instituted, and with booming oil production and prices,
20:15
coupled with big businesses now paying taxes, Russia saw its first year of budget surplus.
20:21
Some of the surplus was used to reform antiquated public utilities while archaic land laws were
20:27
modernized. Meanwhile, the expansion of central power and a major offensive against crime restored
20:33
a sense of stability for the Russian people and investors. Along with this, larger subsidies and support were given to large industries, which slowly
20:42
decreased unemployment. Yet a key characteristic of Putin's economic strategy was an adherence to prudent monetary
20:49
and fiscal policy. From the late 1990s to 2007 foreign debts shrank from 131 billion dollars to just 40
20:58
Billion. This was just 3% of GDP, the healthiest among the top 20 largest economies in the world.
21:06
Meanwhile a new stabilization fund, along with the central bank, soaked up excess oil revenues, eventually amassing into an impressive war chest of cash to use in times of crisis.
21:17
With all of these factors combined, the Russian's economy started booming, growing by on average
21:22
7.2% a year during Putin's first 7 years in power. Although a vast majority of that growth funneled to just a tiny minority of business owners.
21:32
And while most Big business owners played by Putin's rules, there was one exception.
21:37
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who had acquired Yukos, a large oil company when Yeltsin sold it off
21:42
for political support. He then turned Yukos from an inefficient company into a wildly profitable enterprise, in the
21:50
process becoming the richest man in Russia. He did not heed Putin's threats and continued to talk openly of his political aspirations,
21:58
payed off parliament members to favor laws that benefited Yukos, exposed corruption among Putin's government and was actively in talks to sell off Russia's largest oil fields to
22:08
the American based Exxonmobil. In a stunning move, Putin ordered Authorities to arrest Khodorkovsky for tax fraud in which
22:16
he was found guilty, stripped of his businesses and sent to prison for 10 years.
22:21
Yukos was then merged with the State owned Rosneft which quickly became Russia's largest
22:26
oil company. This high profile case which attracted international attention, masked a much larger effort by
22:33
the government to retake control of sectors it deemed as strategically important, including
22:39
military and nuclear power manufacturing and vast portions of the profitable natural resource
22:44
extraction sector. Meanwhile thousands of small to medium sized enterprises began to be ransacked by the government
22:51
itself or by corrupt state officials for personal gain. Soon, either by representation on company boards, direct ownership or by implicit threat,
23:01
the government came to dominate a huge number of industries, eventually becoming the single
23:07
most important entity in the economy, representing 70% of economic activity by 2015.
23:14
Putin's carefully crafted political economic system started to look much more like Soviet
23:19
central control than a modern market based democratic system, and can be simplified into
23:24
three sectors Sector A includes industries that are internationally competitive and bring in a vast majority of money, equalling some 85% of export revenues.
23:36
This sector is entirely dominated by the government and includes oil, gas, mining, and large agricultural
23:43
companies, as well as military and nuclear manufacturing. Sector B is represented by non competitive industries that rely on government subsidies,
23:52
credit and or laws to prevent competition. They are geared toward selling to the domestic population and include the car industry, ship
24:00
building and social groups reliant on the government for income, namely civil servants
24:05
and pensioners. This sector, which supports a vast majority of Russians is therefore directly reliant
24:11
on the government redistributing revenues from Sector A. This means the survivability of these companies are not reliant upon innovation nor improving
24:21
efficiency, but in proving their importance to the government, whether that be providing consumer goods, employing lots of people.
24:28
In essence, the government uses revenue, mainly from oil and gas to keep people working, and
24:34
in doing so gains political support from the general population and business owners.
24:40
Sector C operates without government intervention and includes retail, construction and many
24:45
small businesses the government does not deem strategically important. This sector does not generate much tax revenue but also does not need government support
24:54
to survive. Being left to their own, this is the sector that can spur on productivity gains and innovation,
25:01
Yet continually weak property rights stifles investment and or discourages all together
25:06
new businesses from emerging. After all, why invest in a new venture or expand your company, if it can be seized by
25:13
corrupt state officials. As a result this sector remains small and largely insignificant.
25:20
This entire system was carefully crafted to cement Political power for Putin and other
25:25
elites, while also catering to a wide range of competing interests. Control of sector A gives the government direct access to the major sources of revenue, while
25:35
keeping the most powerful businessmen in alignment with the state. An inefficient Sector B that relies upon the government gives millions of people employment,
25:43
and in doing so generates political support for Putin. Meanwhile, the stronger and more centralized state is able to crack down on crime, and
25:52
intervene in times of crisis with its massive war chest of cash. As far as the average citizen is concerned this system has worked, as quality of life
26:01
has substantially improved since the bleak 1990s. Life expectancy is now much higher, Inflation has stayed modest, while unemployment and
26:10
crime have stayed relatively low. Even though the economy had grown wildly unequal, life was simply better than it was prior.
26:18
Yet fundamentally Putin's economy carries on the legacies of the Soviet Union's flaws.
26:24
Productivity and innovation remains painfully stagnated and as such wages perpetually lack
26:29
behind workers' European counterparts. Just like the Soviet Union, many industries rely on technical imports and financing from
26:36
the west, including advanced machinery, oil extraction methods and complex components
26:42
like microchips. Meanwhile the economy itself is still almost entirely dependent on the Price of Oil.
26:48
When Oil prices are high the economy booms and profits from sector A trickle to the rest
26:53
of the economy. When Prices are low the economy enters severe recessions. While growth slowed after 2008, the economy was still largely stable.
27:03
This all started to change in 2014, when Russian foreign policy took a sharp turn.
Fortress Russia Policy
27:12
As Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in 2014, Heavily Armed
27:18
separatists along with Russian troops took control of Crimea, which was soon after illegally
27:24
annexed by Russia. At the same time Russia started supplying separatists and carrying out military operations
27:30
in the Donbas region. As this was a gross violation of international law, Europe and the United states slapped
27:37
Russia with economic sanctions ranging from freezing Russian elites assets, banning the
27:42
sale of key technical components and weapons, prohibiting western involvement in new energy
27:48
projects and most critically restricting loans to strategic sectors of the Russian Economy.
27:54
Along with falling oil prices the Russian economy entered a severe recession. Russian politics quickly became embroiled in trying to find a way to “sanction proof”
28:03
the economy in a so-called Fortress Russia policy. To attempt this, Russian industries started producing banned components, or finding other
28:11
sources from Asia. An alternative to national payments was rolled out, while a huge drive to expand and modernize
28:18
the military saw expenditure rise from 3.8% to 5.5% of GDP, far outpacing the spending
28:25
rates seen in Europe and even the US. The government and private companies started to further shed external debts while the central
28:33
bank sold off its reserves of US dollars in favor of European and Chinese currencies.
28:39
At the same time, a greater emphasis was placed on increasing Russia's financial war chest,
28:45
which was aided by energy prices recovering, and the government cutting social spending. By 2021, Russia had over 600 billion dollars worth of reserves to use in case of an emergency.
28:57
All of these efforts to build a fortress Russian economy, and Putin's 22 years of cementing
29:02
political and economic power would be put to the test, when in early 2022, he launched
29:08
his so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine.
The Russian Ukrainian War
29:14
On February 24th, 2022, Russian troops and tanks rolled across the Ukrainian border,
29:21
while missiles fired indiscriminately, raining down on strategic targets and civilian cities
29:26
alike. It didn't take long for the West to strike back the harshest and most comprehensive sanctions
29:32
in almost a century, amounting to a full on economic war. Targeted measures crippled the trade of badly needed materials and complex components.
29:41
Meanwhile, Russia's central bank had more than 60% of its reserves frozen by western
29:47
Institutions, and eventually Russia was cut off from Swift, the international bank messaging
29:53
system, which in a globalized world, was seen as a killshot straight to the heart of the
29:58
Russian economy. The general consensus being blasted from experts, economists and the media, foretold of Russia's
30:05
impending economic Catastrophe. Forecasts ranged from a complete collapse of Russia's financial system, to hyperinflation,
30:11
to a catastrophic shrinking of 15% of its GDP by year's end.
30:16
Western sanctions in theory were designed to cripple Russia as follows. The sharp negative external shocks to trade and the financial sector would see a huge
30:25
outflow of money from Russia immediately causing the Rouble to collapse and inflation to spike.
30:31
In a panic and to preserve savings, a critical mass of Russians would then try to pull money
30:37
out of their bank accounts causing a banking crisis. An ensuing decrease in credit, demand and access to critical imports would force industries
30:46
to shut down production leading to further inflation and unemployment. State revenues would dwindle, forcing a contraction of spending, leading to a further decline
30:55
in economic activity. The result would be a breakdown in Russia's economy, rendering Putin incapable of financing
31:02
a war while contending with mass social unrest, which in turn would hopefully lead to a retreat
31:08
from Ukraine. Initially signs pointing to this being a potential reality. 250 Billions of dollars worth of capital which is equal in value to 14% of Russia's GDP poured
31:20
out of the country, while the Rouble collapsed by over 50%. Airline prices more than doubled as hundreds of thousands of wealthy and educated workers
31:30
fled the nation, while everybody else tried to take their money out of the banks, and protests erupted .Meanwhile almost all international corporations pull out of the country including
31:41
McDonalds, who's opening 32 years ago in Moscow symbolized just how much the Soviet Union
31:47
was changing, its departure from Russia in 2022 marked a new era of rapid change to the
31:54
Russian economy. Yet a year on, Russia is still engaging in a fierce and protracted war.
Why Russia’s Economy Has Not Collapsed
32:00
While Sanctions have historically never been capable of stopping conflict, Russia's economy
32:05
appeared to have surpassed every single gloomy prediction. By the end of 2022, GDP barely shrank, inflation increased but by much less than expected,
32:16
and unemployment reached all time lows, while the state has become stuffed with cash. All of this is a by-product of quick action by the Russian state and years of preparation.
32:26
To stop initial panic in the financial sector, interest rates were massively raised to send
32:31
a message that they were serious about tackling inflation which not only curtailed a run on banks but even encouraged Russians who had taken money out of the banks during the pandemic
32:41
to deposit it back in. Meanwhile the state introduced further aid and subsidies to companies and banks to keep
32:48
investment levels up. As the Rouble collapsed, the government banned foreign currency from being exported, and
32:55
forced 80% of any profits made by companies selling overseas to buy back Rubles.
33:01
In combination with a sharp drop in imports, the Rouble bounced back to hit 8 year highs.
33:07
In essence the government, through various controls mechanisms, had artificially raised the value of the Rouble by increasing demand and reducing supply.
33:17
Even as over half of Russia's war chest was frozen by western institutions, it still had
33:22
300 billion dollars left to work with to intervene in the economy, and coupled with Russia's
33:27
very low foreign debts, banks and companies were not as reliant on western financing as
33:33
they had been prior. These proactive measures and preparations were able to blunt the mechanisms behind a
33:39
financial crisis from occurring, while restoring some semblance of stability and confidence
33:45
to the Russian people. Yet most crucially to all of this, Putin had correctly calculated that despite Russia's
33:51
over reliance on energy exports, Europe had become equally reliant upon Russia energy
33:57
imports. In 2021, Europe imported a titanic, 155 Billion cubic meters of natural gas, 108 million tons
34:07
of crude oil, 91 million tons of petroleum products and 51.4 million tons of coal from
34:14
Russia While nations pledged to reduce their imports from Russia, the logistical and financial strains behind quickly finding alternative
34:22
sources proved easier said than done. And yet, at the very same time, the geopolitical and economic uncertainty that such a large
34:31
war caused, in combination with a surge in demand from economies reopening after the
34:36
pandemic, saw oil and gas prices hit eleven year highs. While the total volume of energy exports from Russia did decline in 2022, Russia saw its
34:47
largest gush of oil and gas revenues in its history, at 230 billion dollars or 34% more
34:55
than the year prior. Total commodities export revenues reached 580 billion dollars, or 40% more than its
35:02
ten year average. And when combined with a drop in imports, Russia recorded a trade surplus between January
35:10
and September of 198 billion dollars, or more than double the previous record in 2008.
35:17
Gazprom alone paid 5 trillion roubles in taxes or more than half the total government spending
35:23
on the war and security thus far. Instead of having to cut back spending, the government has dramatically increased subsidies
35:30
to sector B, and ramped up military spending. In effect, Russia has used the proceeds of its oil and gas sales to Europe to continue
35:38
its brutal campaign in Ukraine. While most European countries have by now shifted large portions of its energy imports
35:46
away from Russia, Trade with non western countries has boomed. Particularly with India, Turkey and China, who are more than happy to not only soak up
35:56
discounted energy imports, but also provide Russia with now banned Western components,
36:02
technology and industrial inputs. At the same time, central Asian countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Georgia have
36:10
been used as bypasses to sanctions, as European goods are bought by middlemen in the country
36:16
who then resell to Russia, which has kept many factories running as usual.
36:21
Meanwhile gigantic so called shadow fleets of oil tankers are using non western ships,
36:27
logistics and financing to keep Russian exports flowing. The War has also brought a boom to the military industrial complex, with some factories running
36:36
24 hours a day, while other new industries have emerged to replace previously imported
36:41
goods and services. So with only a small hit to GDP, record profits, a nearly full war chest of cash and eager
36:50
new trading partners and supply lines, does this mean Putin has really constructed an economy impervious to sanctions, one that will be capable of funding the war indefinitely,
37:00
and one that will continue to prop up Russia as a major power going forward The answer in the long run is almost certainly no.
Russia’s Bleak Economic Future
37:11
While headline statistics for 2022, point toward Russia's economic resilience, all they
37:17
do is mask a truly bleak future outlook for Russia. To start we must take into account that going into to 2022, without the war, the Russian
37:27
economy was set to grow by 4%, meaning that 2.1% contraction has set Russia's economy
37:34
back 6% from where it could have been, while undoubtedly the war itself, continued sanctions,
37:40
and a gradual normalization of oil prices will zap growth going forward.
37:45
Indeed, it is likely that Russia's GDP won't return to its 2021 level for 5 years, while
37:53
its 2022 potential GDP won't be reached until 2032. And while certain sectors of the economy have managed to stay afloat, other more vulnerable
38:02
industries such as car manufacturing have seen their production plummet by 80%.
38:07
Not only does this highlight certain sectors' continued reliance on western parts and microchips,
38:12
but it also shows a real erosion of Russian citizens buying power. Other industries such as military manufacturing which soared and provided employment, does
38:22
not actually improve the economy or its people. After all, artillery shell and tank production contribute to GDP yet can't be consumed by
38:31
the Russian people nor does it improve the economy's production capabilities. And while domestic substitutions and imports replace Western equipment and machines, they
38:41
are of poorer quality and or price, which will inevitably mean a reduction in productivity.
38:47
Yet what must worry Putin the most in the short term is the fact that a year on, most European nations have been able to move away from their Russian energy dependence, enabling
38:58
the first round of significant measures to undermine Russia's ability to finance the
39:03
war. In December 2022 Western nations implemented a 60 dollar price cap on Russian crude oil.
39:10
This not only limits the amount of money Russia can make from energy sales to the west but it also bans western companies from financing, shipping and insuring seaborn oil exports
39:21
above 60 dollars a barrel. This is incredibly crucial as western institutions dominate global oil logistics and financing,
39:29
meaning even if oil is being exported to non western nations, if they are to use western
39:35
companies to help, they must cooperate with the price cap. Meanwhile, outside of the west, there are very few companies capable of putting up the
39:43
needed capital and or stomaching the insurance risks associated with long voyage oil transport.
39:50
Even if Russia uses shadow fleets and manages to get non western companies to facilitate
39:55
exports, the price cap gives other oil importing nations a greater hand at negotiating prices.
40:02
Indeed China, India and Turkey have all been buying Russian oil at steep discounts.
40:08
By January 2023 Russian oil was selling at 38 dollars a barrel or half the international
40:14
price from other nations. Meanwhile oil sales to non European nations are also more expensive because of longer
40:21
voyages meaning less profit. At the same time. due to Europe now having found alternative sources, a complete banning of oil and refined
40:30
products went into effect in February 2023. Even though this ban does not encompass natural gas exports, Putin during the winter started
40:39
throttling gas supplies in a bid to blackmail countries supplying aid to Ukraine, and when
40:45
combined with the clandestine bombing of the Nord stream pipeline, gas exports now stand
40:50
at just 20% their 2021 level. This has not only accelerated a shift away from Russian gas, but due to cutbacks on the
40:58
use of gas and a warm winter, Europe's reserves stand at more than 80% capacity, meaning they
41:05
will have enough supplies to avoid fuel shortages until at least 2025, enabling them to fully
41:11
wean off of Russian gas in time. Meanwhile the building of new pipelines and other infrastructure to sell to asia will
41:18
take five plus years, be expensive , and be inhibited from lack of access to western technologies,
41:24
not to mention, India and China have comparably small demands for refined petroleum products.
41:30
Therefore, today and going forward, even if oil and gas prices rise, Russia's ability
41:35
to profit from exports has been greatly diminished which as we know will have a catastrophic
41:41
rippling effect for the rest of the economy and limit the amount of resources that can be diverted toward the military and sector B.
41:48
This has already started to occur. Gas exports are now at the lowest level since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian
41:55
oil is selling at almost a third their peak prices in May 2022, meanwhile military spending
42:02
has had to rise significantly in the face of a stalling war effort, while non oil sector
42:07
government revenues have fallen by 20%. Indeed, Immediately after the price cap went into effect, in a single month in January,
42:16
Russia experienced a budget deficit of 23.6 billion dollars. In reaction the government has had to start aggressively taking out expensive domestic
42:25
debts, and dipping into its reserves of cash. While it is not a good practice to extrapolate data out this far, Russia is currently on
42:33
track to exhaust its entire reserves of cash, in just 1 to 4 years.
42:39
While Putin still has the revenue and reserves to continue the war in the short term, it is starting to become much more costly.
42:46
Meanwhile massive cuts to social spending, a continued erosion of citizens buying power and a war that is becoming more domestically unpopular every day, means political and social
42:57
instability will start to rapidly accelerate. While the war for Putin thus far has been rather unsuccessful, he has greatly succeeded
43:05
at accelerating long standing forces against the Russian economy. Even if miraculously, the war stops overnight and sanctions are lifted, the 50 year long
43:15
trade cycle of selling oil to Europe in return for technology to boost productivity, is likely
43:21
to be either completely severed or at least greatly reduced. Meanwhile, as the world inevitably switches away from fossil fuels, Russia's major revenue
43:29
stream will slowly become less profitable. Yet the fundamental structure of the economy Putin created, is not geared toward the innovation
43:37
required to diversify away from energy exports. But most dangerous to Russia's long term economic outlooks is the war's contribution to degrading
43:46
Russia's long standing demographic issues. Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia's population has steadily declined
43:55
due to falling fertility rates, an increase in death, and citizens emigrating away.
44:00
This was already going to be an issue as the number of retirings and those needing government support would start to outnumber the working population.
44:08
But with the combination of potentially hundreds of thousands men being wounded or killed on
44:14
the battlefield, and hundreds of thousands of specifically working age and educated people
44:19
leaving the country, coupled with the inevitable decrease of fertility due to economic hardship,
44:25
this has dramatically accelerated Russia's demographic decline. Indeed the number of births in April 2022 was the lowest level seen in Russia since
44:35
Hitlers army was at the doorstep to Moscow. At its current rate, Russia's population could shrink by over 16 percent in the next 50 years.
44:45
Meanwhile the most educated and skilled workers who since 2014 had been increasingly leaving
44:50
the country, are now doing so in massive hordes. In fact, it is speculated that since the war began, over 100,000 IT specialists have fled
45:01
the nation. businesses are already having to cope with labor shortages.
45:06
Putin has therefore rendered Russia's future population to be smaller, less educated, more
45:12
financially strained and ultimately poorer and less powerful. Ever since the Soviet Union started to exploit its vast oil and gas reserves to patch up
45:21
the flaws in its system, Russia has been reliant on its revenue to prop up the rest of the economy. Despite reformers' efforts, the sheer magnitude of social and economic misery the collapse
45:31
of the Soviet Union caused, propagated Russia's flawed transition into a normal western nation.
45:37
Putin was able to fix many issues and finally lead Russia to growth, yet at the same time
45:43
he perpetuated critical long running flaws that stifled a diversification of the economy,
45:49
increases to productivity and ultimately the Russian people's quality of life. In return he cemented political power for himself and the elites that surround him.
45:59
Russia was already facing a bleak economic future as the world inevitably shifts away
46:04
from fossil fuels and it struggles to cope with a shrinking and older population.
46:09
While his economy has weathered the first year of his attempt to brutally conquer Ukraine, he has inexorably sped up his nation's fade into obscurity.
46:18
Putin often espouses that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, he will look back to his war in Ukraine as the worst geopolitical
46:29
catastrophe of the 21st.
