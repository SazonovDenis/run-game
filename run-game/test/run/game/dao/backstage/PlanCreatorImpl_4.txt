I wasn't prepared and my parents didn't know, but | boarded that ship on that September day.
The moment the ship left the river and went into the sea my troubles started. There was strong wind and
the sea was rough. A storm was approaching. | was very scared and | felt seasick. | began to regret my
decision to leave home. | thought every wave was going to sink the ship. | promised myself | would go
home and apologize to my parents as soon as | stepped on dry land again.
The storm was over by the morning. | was still seasick during the day and | was thinking about the terrible
storm. However, the evening was beautiful and the sea was very peaceful.
One of the sailors came to me and we started talking. He made some funny jokes. He asked me what |
thought about the light wind. I told him | was very scared of the storm. The sailor offered me a drink. | got
drunk and that night | slept very well.
The next day, | forgot how scared | was. | also forgot my decision to go back home. Instead | was
dreaming more about travelling by sea.
The next few days the wind was blowing against us and we couldn’t move much. Three days later the
wind increased and we could go faster.
